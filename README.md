# Paradis

This project is to practise making 2D pixel-art games by imitation.

## Hierarchy

- `/` - the root folder is a Unity project.
- `/Assets` - all Unity assets are in here.
- `/Data` - all non-Unity assets are in here. Once the asset is considered done, it is moved to the Unity Assets and tracked there.

## Tooling

- Git LFS - make sure that it has been enabled for your system.
- Unity 2021.3.22f1
- VS Code: following [this](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/other/unity) guide.
